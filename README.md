# Assignment 9
I decided on option 2 for this assignment, which is to come up with a bad UI that doesn't make sense. For this bad UI, you have to "agree to the terms" without even seeing them, and before you're able to enter your name and email. Additionally, the submit button doesn't work and it comes back with an error message.
